# Overview

TRust-DNS Util is a support library for the TRust-DNS libraries.

## dnskey-to-pem

This will take a private DNSKEY as generated by BIND9 and output an OpenSSL compatible PEM formated file. *WARNING* this will contain private key material.

```console
$ cargo run --bin pem-to-public-dnskey -- --help
TRust-DNS dnskey-to-pem 0.11.3
Benjamin Fry <benjaminfry@me.com>
Converts a dnskey, as generated from BIND's dnssec-keygen, into pem format

USAGE:
    dnskey-to-pem [OPTIONS] <PRIVATE_KEY_FILE>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -o, --output <OUTPUT_FILE>    Output FILE to write to [default: out.pem]

ARGS:
    <PRIVATE_KEY_FILE>    Input FILE from which to read the DNSSec private key
```


## pem-to-public-dnskey

This utility can be used to output raw bytes in the DNSKEY RDATA format. This is useful for associating custom public keys with the TrustAnchor facility in TRust-DNS.

```console
$ cargo run --bin pem-to-public-dnskey -- --help
TRust-DNS pem-to-public-dnskey 0.11.3
Benjamin Fry <benjaminfry@me.com>
Converts a PEM formatted pubblic key into a raw public dnskey (this is not the inverse of dnskey_to_pem). This can be used to create a dnskey in the TrustAnchor internal
format.

USAGE:
    pem-to-public-dnskey [OPTIONS] <PEM_KEY_FILE>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -o, --output <OUTPUT_FILE>    Output FILE to write to [default: out.dnskey]

ARGS:
    <PEM_KEY_FILE>    Input PEM FILE from which to read the public key
```

## Versioning

TRust-DNS does it's best job to follow semver. TRust-DNS will be promoted to 1.0 upon stabilization of the publicly exposed APIs. This does not mean that TRust-DNS will necessarily break on upgrades between 0.x updates. Whenever possible, old APIs will be deprecated with notes on what replaced those deprecations. TRust-DNS will make a best effort to never break software which depends on it due to API changes, though this can not be guaranteed. Deprecated interfaces will be maintained for at minimum one major release after that in which they were deprecated (where possible), with the exception of the upgrade to 1.0 where all deprecated interfaces will be planned to be removed.
