These are end-to-end, binary-level tests that rely on the public DNS testing infrastructure: `extended-dns-errors.com`

As the public DNS infrastructure is not guaranteed to remain unchanged, all the tests here should be rewritten to rely only on local, private resources and moved into the `conformance-tests` or `e2e-tests` test suites.
