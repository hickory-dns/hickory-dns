##
## This is an example configuration file for the Hickory DNS named server.
##
## The format is in TOML: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml which was chosen
##  as the configuration format for Hickory DNS. While Hickory DNS is intended to
##  be a drop-in replacement for BIND9, it will not support the named.conf files
##  directly. At some point, there will be a binary tool for converting the
##  BIND9 configuration files over to Hickory DNS TOML.
##
## Many of these options are available as both command line options and
##  configuration options in these files. In that case, the command line option
##  will take precedence.
##
## Comments with two hash marks, ##, document the config parameter
## Comments with one hash mark, #, is an example line and should be the default
##
## The root options are similar to the options in 'options { .. }' in named.conf

## listen_addrs: address on which to listen for incoming connections
##  this can be a list of ipv4 or ipv6 addresses
# listen_addrs_ipv4 = ["0.0.0.0"]
# listen_addrs_ipv6 = ["::0"]

## listen_port: port on which to list, default 53
# listen_port = 53

## tcp_request_timeout: TCP request timeout in seconds. Allows TCP connections
##  to timeout if there are no requests from a client in the specified amount of
##  time. This is not a socket level timeout, so trickles of data will not count,
##  a full request must be received for it to not count against the timeout.
##  Specifying a timeout of 0 will disable it.
# tcp_request_timeout = 5

## DNS over TLS certificate information.
# tls_cert = { path = "path/to/some.pkcs12", password = "if_encrypted" }

## port on which to listen, default 853 (should not be 53)
# tls_listen_port = 853

## directory: path on the host filesystem to where zone files are stored.
# directory = "/var/named"

## Denied networks, a list of CIDRs in IPv4 or IPv6 formats,
##  any request that does not originate from the specified networks will be allowed
# deny_networks = ["127.0.0.0/8", "::1/128"]

## Allowed networks, a list of CIDRs in IPv4 or IPv6 formats,
##  any request that does not originate from the specified networks will be denied, unless
##  there are deny_networks specified, in that case, the allow list will be processed as
##  an override to the deny_networks. That is, if there is a deny_list and the network does
##  not appear there, even if does not appear in the allow list the request will be allowed.
# allow_networks = ["127.0.0.0/8", "::1/128"]

## Default zones, these should be present on all nameservers, except in rare
##  configuration cases

## supported_algorithms below).
## these keys will also be registered as authorities for update,
## meaning that SIG(0) updates can be established by initially using these

## to limit this set for performance reasons.
# enable_dnssec = false

## set of DNSSEC algorithms to use to sign the zone. enable_dnssec must be true.
## these will be lookedup by $file.{key_name}.pem, for backward compatibility
## with previous versions of Hickory DNS, if enable_dnssec is enabled but
## supported_algorithms is not specified, it will default to "RSASHA256" and
## look for the $file.pem for the key. To control key length, or other options
## keys of the specified formats can be generated in PEM format. Instructions
## for custom keys can be found elsewhere.
##
## supported extensions are 'der', 'pem'. ED25519 keys are only supported
## with 'pk8'.

## the currently supported set of supported_algorithms are
## ["RSASHA256", "RSASHA512", "ECDSAP256SHA256", "ECDSAP384SHA384", "ED25519"]
