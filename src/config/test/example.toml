#
# This is an example configuration file for the TRust-DNS named server.
#
# The format is in TOML: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml which was chosen
#  as the configuration format for TRust-DNS. While Trust-DNS is inteaded to
#  be a drop-in replacement for BIND9, it will not support the named.conf files
#  directly. At some point, there will be a binary tool for converting the
#  BIND9 configuration files over to TRust-DNS TOML.
#
# Many of these options are available as both command line options and
#  configuration options in these files. In that case, the command line option
#  will take presidence.
#
# Comments with two hash marks, ##, document the config parameter
# Comments with one hash mark, #, is an example line and should be the default
#
# The root options are similar to the options in 'options { .. }' in named.conf
