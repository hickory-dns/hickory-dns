description = """
TRust-DNS is a safe and secure DNS server and client with DNSec support.
 Eventually this could be a replacement for BIND9. DNSSec on the client side,
 with NSEC validation for negative records, is complete. The client and
 server both support dynamic DNS with authenticated requests.
