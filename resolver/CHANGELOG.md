### Changed

- *breaking* `LookupIp` now returns an iterator over owned data (IpAddr is Copy + Clone ref not necessary)

- rewrote much of the caching and lookup functionality for generic RecordType lookups
- removed &mut from resolver fn interfaces, make it easier to use

### Added

- Generic record type lookup
- reverse_lookup for IP to Name lookups
- ipv4_lookup for looking up *only* ipv4 (lookup_ip has options for dual-stack)
- ipv6_lookup for looking up *only* ipv6 (lookup_ip has options for dual-stack)
- mx_lookup for querying mail exchanges
- srv_lookup for service records and also a specialized form for ease of use lookup_service
