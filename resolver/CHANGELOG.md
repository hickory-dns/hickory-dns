This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 0.7.0

### Changed

- Resolver no longer depends on Client
- *breaking* Resolver no longer returns io:Errors, use `From<ResolveError>` for `io::Error`

- CNAME chaining was cleaned up #271 (@briansmith)

### Added

- ResolveError and associated types

## 0.6.0

### Changed

- Split UDP and TCP into different NS pools, prefer UDP lookups first
- On truncated UDP responses, promote to TCP for resolution

### Added

- 64bit Windows support for reading DNS configuration! (@liranringel)
- CNAME chain resolution (where CNAME results are not returned in the same query)
- Resolution prefers `/etc/hosts` before querying (@cssivision)

## 0.5.0

### Changed

- *breaking* `LookupIp` now returns an iterator over owned data (IpAddr is Copy + Clone ref not necessary)
- *breaking* `Resolver::lookup` will now return an Err on NxDomain and NoData responses
- rewrote much of the caching and lookup functionality for generic RecordType lookups
- removed &mut from resolver fn interfaces, make it easier to use

### Added

- Generic record type lookup
- reverse_lookup for IP to Name lookups
- ipv4_lookup for looking up *only* ipv4 (lookup_ip has options for dual-stack)
- ipv6_lookup for looking up *only* ipv6 (lookup_ip has options for dual-stack)
- mx_lookup for querying mail exchanges
- srv_lookup for service records and also a specialized form for ease of use lookup_service
- txt_lookup for text record lookups

- support for search names in `ResolverConfig` and `LookupIpFuture`
- `LookupIpFuture` type alias to `InnerLookupIpFuture<NameServerPool>` *compatibility*

### Changed

- *breaking* `LookupIpFuture` renamed to `InnerLookupIpFuture`
- *breaking* `InnerLookupIpFuture` now takes a generic parameter, generally `<NameServerPool>`

## 0.2.0

### Added

- ipv6 parallel lookup
- multiple ipv4 and ipv6 lookup strategies
- library documentation examples
