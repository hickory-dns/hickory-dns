# A short blurb about the package. This is not rendered in any format when
# uploaded to crates.io (aka this is not markdown)
description = """
TRust-DNS is a safe and secure DNS library. This Resolver library  uses the Client library to perform all DNS queries. *Notes on current limitations*: DNSSec is not yet supported in the Resolver, use the `trust-dns` Client if DNSSec validation is needed. Many standard system options and configurations are not yet supported. The host system `/etc/resolv.conf` is not yet being used. Recursion is not yet built, i.e. CNAME chains will not be fully resolved, though many upstream resolvers will handle this making it a non-blocking issue.
