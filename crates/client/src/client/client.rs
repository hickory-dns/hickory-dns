/// and tokio-rs based implementation. This trait implements synchronous functions for ease of use.
///
/// There was a strong attempt to make it backwards compatible, but making it a drop in replacement
/// for the old Client was not possible. This trait has two implementations, the `SyncClient` which
/// is a standard DNS Client, and the `SecureSyncClient` which is a wrapper on `SecureClientHandle`
/// providing DNSSec validation.
///
/// *note* When upgrading from previous usage, both `SyncClient` and `SecureSyncClient` have an
/// signer which can be optionally associated to the Client. This replaces the previous per-function
/// parameter, and it will sign all update requests (this matches the `ClientFuture` API).
