Trust-DNS is a safe and secure DNS library. This Resolver library  uses the Client library to perform all DNS queries. The Resolver is intended to be a high-level library for any DNS record resolution see Resolver and AsyncResolver for supported resolution types. The Client can be used for other queries.
