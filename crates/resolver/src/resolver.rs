/// Special note about resource consumption. The Resolver and all Trust-DNS software is built around the Tokio async-io library. This synchronous Resolver is intended to be a simpler wrapper for of the [`AsyncResolver`]. To allow the `Resolver` to be [`Send`] + [`Sync`], the construction of the `AsyncResolver` is lazy, this means some of the features of the `AsyncResolver`, like performance based resolution via the most efficient `NameServer` will be lost (the lookup cache is shared across invocations of the `Resolver`). If these other features of the Trust-DNS Resolver are desired, please use the tokio based [`AsyncResolver`].

    //   query. A TLS on the other hand would not, at the cost of only allowing a Resolver to be configured once per Thread
