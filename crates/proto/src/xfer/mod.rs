//! DNS high level transit implimentations.
//!
//! Primarily there are two types in this module of interest, the `DnsMultiplexer` type and the `DnsHandle` type. `DnsMultiplexer` can be thought of as the state machine responsible for sending and receiving DNS messages. `DnsHandle` is the type given to API users of the `trust-dns-proto` library to send messages into the `DnsMultiplexer` for delivery. Finally there is the `DnsRequest` type. This allows for customizations, through `DnsRequestOptions`, to the delivery of messages via a `DnsMultiplexer`.
//!
//! TODO: this module needs some serious refactoring and normalization.
