    //
    //  The encoding of the Type Bit Maps field is the same as that used by
    //  the NSEC RR, described in [RFC4034].  It is explained and clarified
    //  here for clarity.
    //
    //  The RR type space is split into 256 window blocks, each representing
    //  the low-order 8 bits of the 16-bit RR type space.  Each block that
    //  has at least one active RR type is encoded using a single octet
    //  window number (from 0 to 255), a single octet bitmap length (from 1
    //  to 32) indicating the number of octets used for the bitmap of the
    //  window block, and up to 32 octets (256 bits) of bitmap.
    //
    //  Blocks are present in the NSEC3 RR RDATA in increasing numerical
    //  order.
    //
    //     Type Bit Maps Field = ( Window Block # | Bitmap Length | Bitmap )+
    //
    //     where "|" denotes concatenation.
    //
    //  Each bitmap encodes the low-order 8 bits of RR types within the
    //  window block, in network bit order.  The first bit is bit 0.  For
    //  window block 0, bit 1 corresponds to RR type 1 (A), bit 2 corresponds
    //  to RR type 2 (NS), and so forth.  For window block 1, bit 1
    //  corresponds to RR type 257, bit 2 to RR type 258.  If a bit is set to
    //  1, it indicates that an RRSet of that type is present for the
    //  original owner name of the NSEC3 RR.  If a bit is set to 0, it
    //  indicates that no RRSet of that type is present for the original
    //  owner name of the NSEC3 RR.
    //
    //  Since bit 0 in window block 0 refers to the non-existing RR type 0,
    //  it MUST be set to 0.  After verification, the validator MUST ignore
    //  the value of bit 0 in window block 0.
    //
    //  Bits representing Meta-TYPEs or QTYPEs as specified in Section 3.1 of
    //  [RFC2929] or within the range reserved for assignment only to QTYPEs
    //  and Meta-TYPEs MUST be set to 0, since they do not appear in zone
    //  data.  If encountered, they must be ignored upon reading.
    //
    //  Blocks with no types present MUST NOT be included.  Trailing zero
    //  octets in the bitmap MUST be omitted.  The length of the bitmap of
    //  each block is determined by the type code with the largest numerical
    //  value, within that block, among the set of RR types present at the
    //  original owner name of the NSEC3 RR.  Trailing octets not specified
    //  MUST be interpreted as zero octets.
