/// The OPT record type is used for ExtendedDNS records.
///
/// These allow for additional information to be associated with the DNS request that otherwise
/// would require changes to the DNS protocol.
///
/// [RFC 6891, EDNS(0) Extensions, April 2013](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6891#section-6)
///
/// ```text
/// 6.1.  OPT Record Definition
///
/// 6.1.1.  Basic Elements
///
///    An OPT pseudo-RR (sometimes called a meta-RR) MAY be added to the
///    additional data section of a request.
///
///    The OPT RR has RR type 41.
///
///    If an OPT record is present in a received request, compliant
///    responders MUST include an OPT record in their respective responses.
///
///    An OPT record does not carry any DNS data.  It is used only to
///    contain control information pertaining to the question-and-answer
///    sequence of a specific transaction.  OPT RRs MUST NOT be cached,
///    forwarded, or stored in or loaded from Zone Files.
///
///    The OPT RR MAY be placed anywhere within the additional data section.
///    When an OPT RR is included within any DNS message, it MUST be the
///    only OPT RR in that message.  If a query message with more than one
///    OPT RR is received, a FORMERR (RCODE=1) MUST be returned.  The
///    placement flexibility for the OPT RR does not override the need for
///    the TSIG or SIG(0) RRs to be the last in the additional section
///    whenever they are present.
///
/// 6.1.2.  Wire Format
///
///    An OPT RR has a fixed part and a variable set of options expressed as
///    {attribute, value} pairs.  The fixed part holds some DNS metadata,
///    and also a small collection of basic extension elements that we
///    expect to be so popular that it would be a waste of wire space to
///    encode them as {attribute, value} pairs.
///
///    The fixed part of an OPT RR is structured as follows:
///
///        +------------+--------------+------------------------------+
///        | Field Name | Field Type   | Description                  |
///        +------------+--------------+------------------------------+
///        | NAME       | domain name  | MUST be 0 (root domain)      |
///        | TYPE       | u_int16_t    | OPT (41)                     |
///        | CLASS      | u_int16_t    | requestor's UDP payload size |
///        | TTL        | u_int32_t    | extended RCODE and flags     |
///        | RDLEN      | u_int16_t    | length of all RDATA          |
///        | RDATA      | octet stream | {attribute,value} pairs      |
///        +------------+--------------+------------------------------+
///
///                                OPT RR Format
///
///    The variable part of an OPT RR may contain zero or more options in
///    the RDATA.  Each option MUST be treated as a bit field.  Each option
///    is encoded as:
///
///                   +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
///        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
///     0: |                          OPTION-CODE                          |

///     4: |                                                               |

///        /                                                               /

///
///    OPTION-CODE

///       working group and the IESG.
///
///    OPTION-LENGTH
///       Size (in octets) of OPTION-DATA.
///
///    OPTION-DATA
///       Varies per OPTION-CODE.  MUST be treated as a bit field.
///
///    The order of appearance of option tuples is not defined.  If one
///    option modifies the behaviour of another or multiple options are
///    related to one another in some way, they have the same effect
///    regardless of ordering in the RDATA wire encoding.
///
///    Any OPTION-CODE values not understood by a responder or requestor
///    MUST be ignored.  Specifications of such options might wish to
///    include some kind of signaled acknowledgement.  For example, an
///    option specification might say that if a responder sees and supports
///    option XYZ, it MUST include option XYZ in its response.
///
/// 6.1.3.  OPT Record TTL Field Use
///
///    The extended RCODE and flags, which OPT stores in the RR Time to Live
///    (TTL) field, are structured as follows:
///
///                   +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
///        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
///     0: |         EXTENDED-RCODE        |            VERSION            |
///        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
///     2: | DO|                           Z                               |
///        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
///
///    EXTENDED-RCODE
///       Forms the upper 8 bits of extended 12-bit RCODE (together with the
///       4 bits defined in [RFC1035].  Note that EXTENDED-RCODE value 0
///       indicates that an unextended RCODE is in use (values 0 through
///       15).
///
///    VERSION
///       Indicates the implementation level of the setter.  Full
///       conformance with this specification is indicated by version '0'.
///       Requestors are encouraged to set this to the lowest implemented
///       level capable of expressing a transaction, to minimise the
///       responder and network load of discovering the greatest common
///       implementation level between requestor and responder.  A
///       requestor's version numbering strategy MAY ideally be a run-time
///       configuration option.
///       If a responder does not implement the VERSION level of the
///       request, then it MUST respond with RCODE=BADVERS.  All responses
///       MUST be limited in format to the VERSION level of the request, but
///       the VERSION of each response SHOULD be the highest implementation
///       level of the responder.  In this way, a requestor will learn the
///       implementation level of a responder as a side effect of every
///       response, including error responses and including RCODE=BADVERS.
