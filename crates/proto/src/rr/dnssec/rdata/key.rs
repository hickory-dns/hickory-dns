/// ```text
/// 3. The KEY Resource Record
///
///    The KEY resource record (RR) is used to store a public key that is
///    associated with a Domain Name System (DNS) name.  This can be the
///    public key of a zone, a user, or a host or other end entity. Security
///    aware DNS implementations MUST be designed to handle at least two
///    simultaneously valid keys of the same type associated with the same
///    name.
///
///    The type number for the KEY RR is 25.
///
///    A KEY RR is, like any other RR, authenticated by a SIG RR.  KEY RRs
///    must be signed by a zone level key.
///
/// 3.1 KEY RDATA format
///
///    The RDATA for a KEY RR consists of flags, a protocol octet, the
///    algorithm number octet, and the public key itself.  The format is as
///    follows:
///
///                         1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
///     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
///    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
///    |             flags             |    protocol   |   algorithm   |
///    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
///    |                                                               /
///    /                          public key                           /
///    /                                                               /

///
///    The KEY RR is not intended for storage of certificates and a separate
///    certificate RR has been developed for that purpose, defined in [RFC
///    2538].
///
///    The meaning of the KEY RR owner name, flags, and protocol octet are
///    described in Sections 3.1.1 through 3.1.5 below.  The flags and
///    algorithm must be examined before any data following the algorithm
///    octet as they control the existence and format of any following data.
///    The algorithm and public key fields are described in Section 3.2.
///    The format of the public key is algorithm dependent.
///
///    KEY RRs do not specify their validity period but their authenticating
///    SIG RR(s) do as described in Section 4 below.
///
/// 3.1.1 Object Types, DNS Names, and Keys
///
///    The public key in a KEY RR is for the object named in the owner name.
///
///    A DNS name may refer to three different categories of things.  For
///    example, foo.host.example could be (1) a zone, (2) a host or other
///    end entity , or (3) the mapping into a DNS name of the user or
///    account foo@host.example.  Thus, there are flag bits, as described
///    below, in the KEY RR to indicate with which of these roles the owner
///    name and public key are associated.  Note that an appropriate zone
///    KEY RR MUST occur at the apex node of a secure zone and zone KEY RRs
///    occur only at delegation points.
///
/// 3.1.2 The KEY RR Flag Field
///
///    In the "flags" field:
///
///      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0   1   2   3   4   5
///    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
///    |  A/C  | Z | XT| Z | Z | NAMTYP| Z | Z | Z | Z |      SIG      |
///    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
///
///    Bit 0 and 1 are the key "type" bits whose values have the following
///    meanings:
///
///            10: Use of the key is prohibited for authentication.
///            01: Use of the key is prohibited for confidentiality.
///            00: Use of the key for authentication and/or confidentiality
///                is permitted. Note that DNS security makes use of keys
///                for authentication only. Confidentiality use flagging is
///                provided for use of keys in other protocols.
///                Implementations not intended to support key distribution
///                for confidentiality MAY require that the confidentiality
///                use prohibited bit be on for keys they serve.
///            11: If both bits are one, the "no key" value, there is no key
///                information and the RR stops after the algorithm octet.
///                By the use of this "no key" value, a signed KEY RR can
///                authenticatably assert that, for example, a zone is not
///                secured.  See section 3.4 below.
///
///    Bits 2 is reserved and must be zero.
///
///    Bits 3 is reserved as a flag extension bit.  If it is a one, a second
///           16 bit flag field is added after the algorithm octet and
///           before the key data.  This bit MUST NOT be set unless one or
///           more such additional bits have been defined and are non-zero.
///
///    Bits 4-5 are reserved and must be zero.
///
///    Bits 6 and 7 form a field that encodes the name type. Field values
///    have the following meanings:
///
///            00: indicates that this is a key associated with a "user" or
///                "account" at an end entity, usually a host.  The coding
///                of the owner name is that used for the responsible
///                individual mailbox in the SOA and RP RRs: The owner name
///                is the user name as the name of a node under the entity
///                name.  For example, "j_random_user" on
///                host.subdomain.example could have a public key associated
///                through a KEY RR with name
///                j_random_user.host.subdomain.example.  It could be used
///                in a security protocol where authentication of a user was
///                desired.  This key might be useful in IP or other
///                security for a user level service such a telnet, ftp,
///                rlogin, etc.
///            01: indicates that this is a zone key for the zone whose name
///                is the KEY RR owner name.  This is the public key used
///                for the primary DNS security feature of data origin
///                authentication.  Zone KEY RRs occur only at delegation
///                points.
///            10: indicates that this is a key associated with the non-zone
///                "entity" whose name is the RR owner name.  This will
///                commonly be a host but could, in some parts of the DNS
///                tree, be some other type of entity such as a telephone
///                number [RFC 1530] or numeric IP address.  This is the
///                public key used in connection with DNS request and
///                transaction authentication services.  It could also be
///                used in an IP-security protocol where authentication at
///                the host, rather than user, level was desired, such as
///                routing, NTP, etc.
///            11: reserved.
///
///    Bits 8-11 are reserved and must be zero.
///
///    Bits 12-15 are the "signatory" field.  If non-zero, they indicate
///               that the key can validly sign things as specified in DNS
///               dynamic update [RFC 2137].  Note that zone keys (see bits
///               6 and 7 above) always have authority to sign any RRs in
///               the zone regardless of the value of the signatory field.

/// 3.1.3 The Protocol Octet
///
///    It is anticipated that keys stored in DNS will be used in conjunction
///    with a variety of Internet protocols.  It is intended that the
///    protocol octet and possibly some of the currently unused (must be
///    zero) bits in the KEY RR flags as specified in the future will be
///    used to indicate a key's validity for different protocols.
///
///    The following values of the Protocol Octet are reserved as indicated:
///
///         VALUE   Protocol
///
///           0      -reserved
///           1     TLS
///           2     email
///           3     dnssec
///           4     IPSEC
///          5-254   - available for assignment by IANA
///          255     All
///
///    In more detail:
///         1 is reserved for use in connection with TLS.
///         2 is reserved for use in connection with email.
///         3 is used for DNS security.  The protocol field SHOULD be set to
///           this value for zone keys and other keys used in DNS security.
///           Implementations that can determine that a key is a DNS
///           security key by the fact that flags label it a zone key or the
///           signatory flag field is non-zero are NOT REQUIRED to check the
///           protocol field.
///         4 is reserved to refer to the Oakley/IPSEC [RFC 2401] protocol
///           and indicates that this key is valid for use in conjunction
///           with that security standard.  This key could be used in
///           connection with secured communication on behalf of an end
///           entity or user whose name is the owner name of the KEY RR if
///           the entity or user flag bits are set.  The presence of a KEY
///           resource with this protocol value is an assertion that the
///           host speaks Oakley/IPSEC.
///         255 indicates that the key can be used in connection with any
///           protocol for which KEY RR protocol octet values have been
///           defined.  The use of this value is discouraged and the use of
///           different keys for different protocols is encouraged.
