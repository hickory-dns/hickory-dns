description = """
*WARNING* This library is experimental

Trust-DNS Recursor is a safe and secure DNS recursive resolver with DNSSEC support.
 Trust-DNS is based on the Tokio and Futures libraries, which means
 it should be easily integrated into other software that also use those
 libraries. This library can be used as in the server and binary for performing recursive lookups.
