    /// 5.3.3. Algorithm
    ///
    /// The top level algorithm has four steps:
    ///
    ///    1. See if the answer is in local information, and if so return
    ///       it to the client.
    ///
    ///    2. Find the best servers to ask.
    ///
    ///    3. Send them queries until one returns a response.
    ///
    ///    4. Analyze the response, either:
    ///
    ///          a. if the response answers the question or contains a name
    ///             error, cache the data as well as returning it back to
    ///             the client.
    ///
    ///          b. if the response contains a better delegation to other
    ///             servers, cache the delegation information, and go to
    ///             step 2.
    ///
    ///          c. if the response shows a CNAME and that is not the
    ///             answer itself, cache the CNAME, change the SNAME to the
    ///             canonical name in the CNAME RR and go to step 1.
    ///
    ///          d. if the response shows a servers failure or other
    ///             bizarre contents, delete the server from the SLIST and
    ///             go back to step 3.
    ///
    /// Step 1 searches the cache for the desired data. If the data is in the
    /// cache, it is assumed to be good enough for normal use.  Some resolvers
    /// have an option at the user interface which will force the resolver to
    /// ignore the cached data and consult with an authoritative server.  This
    /// is not recommended as the default.  If the resolver has direct access to
    /// a name server's zones, it should check to see if the desired data is
    /// present in authoritative form, and if so, use the authoritative data in
    /// preference to cached data.
    ///
    /// Step 2 looks for a name server to ask for the required data.  The
    /// general strategy is to look for locally-available name server RRs,
    /// starting at SNAME, then the parent domain name of SNAME, the
    /// grandparent, and so on toward the root.  Thus if SNAME were
    /// Mockapetris.ISI.EDU, this step would look for NS RRs for
    /// Mockapetris.ISI.EDU, then ISI.EDU, then EDU, and then . (the root).
    /// These NS RRs list the names of hosts for a zone at or above SNAME.  Copy
    /// the names into SLIST.  Set up their addresses using local data.  It may
    /// be the case that the addresses are not available.  The resolver has many
    /// choices here; the best is to start parallel resolver processes looking
    /// for the addresses while continuing onward with the addresses which are
    /// available.  Obviously, the design choices and options are complicated
    /// and a function of the local host's capabilities.  The recommended
    /// priorities for the resolver designer are:
    ///
    ///    1. Bound the amount of work (packets sent, parallel processes
    ///       started) so that a request can't get into an infinite loop or
    ///       start off a chain reaction of requests or queries with other
    ///       implementations EVEN IF SOMEONE HAS INCORRECTLY CONFIGURED
    ///       SOME DATA.
    ///
    ///    2. Get back an answer if at all possible.
    ///
    ///    3. Avoid unnecessary transmissions.
    ///
    ///    4. Get the answer as quickly as possible.
    ///
    /// If the search for NS RRs fails, then the resolver initializes SLIST from
    /// the safety belt SBELT.  The basic idea is that when the resolver has no
    /// idea what servers to ask, it should use information from a configuration
    /// file that lists several servers which are expected to be helpful.
    /// Although there are special situations, the usual choice is two of the
    /// root servers and two of the servers for the host's domain.  The reason
    /// for two of each is for redundancy.  The root servers will provide
    /// eventual access to all of the domain space.  The two local servers will
    /// allow the resolver to continue to resolve local names if the local
    /// network becomes isolated from the internet due to gateway or link
    /// failure.
    ///
    /// In addition to the names and addresses of the servers, the SLIST data
    /// structure can be sorted to use the best servers first, and to insure
    /// that all addresses of all servers are used in a round-robin manner.  The
    /// sorting can be a simple function of preferring addresses on the local
    /// network over others, or may involve statistics from past events, such as
    /// previous response times and batting averages.
    ///
    /// Step 3 sends out queries until a response is received.  The strategy is
    /// to cycle around all of the addresses for all of the servers with a
    /// timeout between each transmission.  In practice it is important to use
    /// all addresses of a multihomed host, and too aggressive a retransmission
    /// policy actually slows response when used by multiple resolvers
    /// contending for the same name server and even occasionally for a single
    /// resolver.  SLIST typically contains data values to control the timeouts
    /// and keep track of previous transmissions.
    ///
    /// Step 4 involves analyzing responses.  The resolver should be highly
    /// paranoid in its parsing of responses.  It should also check that the
    /// response matches the query it sent using the ID field in the response.
    ///
    /// The ideal answer is one from a server authoritative for the query which
    /// either gives the required data or a name error.  The data is passed back
    /// to the user and entered in the cache for future use if its TTL is
    /// greater than zero.
    ///
    /// If the response shows a delegation, the resolver should check to see
    /// that the delegation is "closer" to the answer than the servers in SLIST
    /// are.  This can be done by comparing the match count in SLIST with that
    /// computed from SNAME and the NS RRs in the delegation.  If not, the reply
    /// is bogus and should be ignored.  If the delegation is valid the NS
    /// delegation RRs and any address RRs for the servers should be cached.
    /// The name servers are entered in the SLIST, and the search is restarted.
    ///
    /// If the response contains a CNAME, the search is restarted at the CNAME
    /// unless the response has the data for the canonical name or if the CNAME
    /// is the answer itself.
    ///
    /// Details and implementation hints can be found in [RFC-1035].
    ///
    /// 6. A SCENARIO
    ///
    /// In our sample domain space, suppose we wanted separate administrative
    /// control for the root, MIL, EDU, MIT.EDU and ISI.EDU zones.  We might
    /// allocate name servers as follows:
