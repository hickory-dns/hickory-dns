# Overview

> [!WARNING]
> This library is experimental

`hickory-recursor` is a safe and secure DNS recursive resolver library with DNSSEC support.

This library can be used to perform DNS resolution beginning with a set of root (hints) authorities. 
It does not require an upstream recursive resolver to find records in DNS.
