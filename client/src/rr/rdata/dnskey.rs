/// ```text
/// 2.  The DNSKEY Resource Record
///
///    DNSSEC uses public key cryptography to sign and authenticate DNS
///    resource record sets (RRsets).  The public keys are stored in DNSKEY
///    resource records and are used in the DNSSEC authentication process
///    described in [RFC4035]: A zone signs its authoritative RRsets by
///    using a private key and stores the corresponding public key in a
///    DNSKEY RR.  A resolver can then use the public key to validate
///    signatures covering the RRsets in the zone, and thus to authenticate
///    them.
///
///    The DNSKEY RR is not intended as a record for storing arbitrary
///    public keys and MUST NOT be used to store certificates or public keys
///    that do not directly relate to the DNS infrastructure.
///
///    The Type value for the DNSKEY RR type is 48.
///
///    The DNSKEY RR is class independent.
///
///    The DNSKEY RR has no special TTL requirements.
///
/// 2.1.  DNSKEY RDATA Wire Format
///
///    The RDATA for a DNSKEY RR consists of a 2 octet Flags Field, a 1
///    octet Protocol Field, a 1 octet Algorithm Field, and the Public Key
///    Field.
///
