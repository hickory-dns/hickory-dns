## 0.11.2

(README.md documentation changes for crates.io)

## 0.11.1

### Changed

- Updates to `Name::is_fqdn` for more accuracy (@rushmorem)

### Added

- per project Readme.md for crates.io

## 0.11.0

### Added

- `Name::FromStr` for simpler parsing, specify trailing `.` for FQDN

- *Important* Some `Server` types have been migrated to [RFC#344](https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/conventions-galore/active/0000-conventions-galore.md#gettersetter-apis) style. `get_field()` -> `field()`; `field()` -> `set_field()`

## 0.10.0

### Changed

- *Important* Possible breaking API change, the original Client has been renamed.

In an attempt to reduce the overhead of managing the project. The original
Client has now been revamped to essentially be a synchronous Client over the
ClientFuture implementation. The ClientFuture has proven to be a more stable
and reliable implementation. It was attempted to make the move seamless,
but two new types were introduced, `SyncClient` and `SecureSyncClient`, which
are both synchronous implementations of the old Client function interfaces.
Please read those docs on those new types and the Client trait.

- When EDNS option is present, return only the digest understood matching RRSETs
- All code reformatted with rustfmt
- *Important* breaking change, all `Record` and associated types have been migrated to [RFC#344](https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/conventions-galore/active/0000-conventions-galore.md#gettersetter-apis) style. `get_field()` -> `field()`; `field()` -> `set_field()`

### Removed

- *Important* The original Server implementation was removed entirely.

Please use the ServerFuture implementation from now on. Sorry for the inconvenience,
but this is necessary to make sure that the software remains at a high quality
and there is no easy way to migrate the original Server to use ServerFuture.

### Added

- Initial support for ECDSAP256SHA256, ECDSAP384SHA384 and ED25519 (client and server)
- additional config options for keys to named, see `tests/named_test_configs/example.toml`
