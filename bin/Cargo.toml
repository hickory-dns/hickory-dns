# uploaded to crates.io (aka this is not markdown)
description = """
Trust-DNS is a safe and secure DNS server with DNSEC support.
 Eventually this could be a replacement for BIND9. The DNSSEC support allows
 for live signing of all records, in it does not currently support
 records signed offline. The server supports dynamic DNS with SIG0 authenticated
 requests. Trust-DNS is based on the Tokio and Futures libraries, which means
 it should be easily integrated into other software that also use those
 libraries.
