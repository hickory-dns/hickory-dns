# Architecture of Trust-DNS

The Trust-DNS libraries are built from the ground up to be asynchronous. This project grew from first using non-blocking IO interfaces (before Futures 0.1 or async/await had landed in Rust). There are some artifacts of this history sporadically left around the project. Please feel free to submit PRs that clean up areas that still have hand-written Futures based state-machines. Additionally, much of the project was written by @bluejekyll while he learned the Rust languageâ€“this means that there may be patterns or missing common implementations in places where he didn't know better. Feel free to clean that up if you feel open to submitting a PR.

## Layout

Most of the project is in the form of crates. The crates are all individually published to crates.io.

The project has these high-level crates (to be used as dependencies in other projects):

- **[trust-dns-resolver](crates/resolver)** - implements a stub-resolver with support for CNAME chasing and other things, abstract over runtimes (Tokio supported by default)
- **[async-std-resolver](crates/async-std-resolver)** - an abstraction of trust-dns-resolver using the async-std runtime
- **[trust-dns-client](crates/client)** - a bare-bones client crate, most useful for dynamic DNS updates
- **[trust-dns-server](crates/server)** - implements support for hosted Authorities of various types
- **tokio-resolver** - (under consideration, currently Tokio support is directly in trust-dns-resolver)

Low-level crates supporting the above high-level crates:

- **[trust-dns-proto](crates/proto)** - the lowest level crate, implements the basics of DNS
- **[trust-dns-rustls](crates/rustls)** - DoT (DNS-over-TLS) support for trust-dns using rustls and \*ring\*, client & server
- **[trust-dns-openssl](crates/openssl)** - DoT (DNS-over-TLS) support for trust-dns using OpenSSL (may be removed), client & server
- **[trust-dns-native-tls](crates/native-tls)** - DoT (DNS-over-TLS) support for trust-dns using the OS TLS library, client only
- **[trust-dns-https](crates/https)** - DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) support, currently only supports trust-dns-rustls, client & server

Binaries:

- **[trust-dns](bin/)** - server binary, `named`, for hosting authorites, zones, and/or setting up a forwarder
- **[trust-dns-util](util/)** - helpful utilities, e.g. `resolve` for a CLI resolver, as well as some DNSSEC utilities
